<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>

You have to have the following software installed to compile FLY and
its samples out of the box:

<h2>C compiler and GNU tools</h2>

Right now, FLY is gcc-oriented, and it's written
in the makefiles. Therefore get and install GNU C compiler.
Note: C++ is not needed to compile FLY. Platform details:

<tr><th> Platform
<th> Where to get compiler/tools

<tr><td> OS/2
<td> download emx/gcc and GNU tools. You'll need things from<br>
<tt>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc</tt><br>
and<br>
<tt>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/devtools/gnumake.zip</tt>,<br>
<tt>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/systools/gnufutil.zip</tt>,<br>
<tt>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/systools/gnusutil.zip</tt>,<br>
<tt>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/systools/gnututil.zip</tt>.<br>
Other things from<br>
<tt>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu</tt><br>
are also very useful.
<br>This platform is automatically recognized by FLY makefile.
Targets are <tt>os2vio</tt> (text windows and fullscreen),
<tt>os2pm</tt> (textmode on top of OS/2 GUI), <tt>os2x</tt> (runs
under XFree86/OS2, in xterm).

<tr><td> Linux Intel
<td> gcc and libraries come with the OS.
<br>This platform is automatically recognized by FLY makefile.
Target is <tt>unixterm</tt>.

<tr><td> FreeBSD
<td> gcc and libraries come with the OS.
<br>This platform is automatically recognized by FLY makefile.
Target is <tt>unixterm</tt>.

<tr><td> Solaris Sparc, Intel
<td> gcc 2.8.1 and precompiled GNU tools can be downloaded from
sunfreeware.com (my development happens on Sparc 2.5.1, Intel Solaris 7).
You'll need at least compiler (gcc-2.8.1) and make packages. Bash is
recommended if you want to live comfortably :-) I have not tried
SunSoft compiler. Also install termcap-1.3 from any GNU mirror; without
it, FLY won't compile (Solaris does not have termcap.h).
<br>This platform is automatically recognized by FLY makefile.
Target is <tt>unixterm</tt>.

<tr><td> BeOS R4 Intel
<td> all tools including GNU <tt>make</tt> and egcs come with the OS.
<br>This platform is automatically recognized by FLY makefile. Target
is <tt>beosterm</tt>.

<tr><td> BeOS R3 Intel
<td> all tools are available from GeekGadgets
(<tt>ftp.ninemoons.com:/pub/geekgadgets</tt>).
Since this version is discontinued by Be, Inc. and is incompatible with R4,
it is expected to be excluded from the list of supported by FLY during first
half of 1999. You'll need at least egcs and binutils packages.
<br>This platform is automatically recognized by FLY makefile. Target
is <tt>beosterm</tt>.

<tr><td> Windows 95/98/NT
<td> get and install RSXNT package from
<a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rainer">http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rainer</a>.
You'll also need <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk.htm">Microsoft Platform SDK</a>
as advised in RSXNT docs and GNU tools (<tt>make</tt>, <tt>rm</tt> etc.)
from Cygnus (<tt>ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32</tt>).
Note that RSXNT requires a license to built commercial/shareware applications.
I have not tried gcc from Cygnus.
<br>Under '95 and '98, you'll have to 
<tt>SET OS=windows</tt> in <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> to be recognized by FLY
makefile. Target is <tt>win32cons</tt>.
